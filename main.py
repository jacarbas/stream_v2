        market demand in Spain.
        Through a comprehensive analysis of data, this project seeks to provide 
        insights and recommendations to businesses interested in importing luxury cars to the Spanish market. The ultimate goal is to help businesses make informed decisions that maximize

The map reveals that the west and south regions of Germany tend to have higher average car prices and offer compared to other regions. This pattern can be attributed to the concentration of car factories in these areas, which may drive up prices due to proximity to supply sources and increase availability of cars due to higher accessibility to dealerships and showrooms. The positive correlation between car prices and offer in these regions suggests that the high demand for cars in these areas can also contribute to the high prices.
